This program written in C++ uses a basic genetic algorithm to evaluate a set of inputs of items with an assigned value and weight, creates populations and generations, crosses over samples within each, and then culls them down to create the best possible result. It then uses the previous generation's results to improve the results of the next, and runs for as long as the improvement generation over generation is at least 1%.
